# yt-dlp GUI
## How to use
Download the .exe Binary and put it into the same folder as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
[FFmpeg](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/2025-03-27-git-114fccc4a5) is only required if you want to use postprocessing.
For Mac Users refer to the next chapter.

## For Mac Users
We can't ship the .app so you need to create the executable yourself by using the following command:
'chmod a+rx /Path/to/file'


## Requirements
These binaries need to be added into the same folder as the GUI.
